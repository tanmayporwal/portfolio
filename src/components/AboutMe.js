                    I am a graduate student working towards my masterâ€™s in computer science, learning its concepts to the core. Skilled in Java, SQL, Node.js, and F#. Possess a strong foundation in data structures, distributed systems, and object-oriented programming. I enjoy finding new ways to provide a feasible solution to a broader relevant problem. Problems that require a lot of critical thinking and analytical skills always excites me. My colleagues would describe me as a driven, resourceful person who maintains a positive attitude even in the time of hardships. Currently, I am seeking job opportunities that relate to the field of software development, distributed systems, and full-stack development.
